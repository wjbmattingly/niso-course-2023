# Course Summary

This comprehensive course is designed to equip students with the essential skills and knowledge required to undertake text and data mining tasks. Throughout this course, students will be introduced to key concepts and tools of text and data mining, including data types, data structures, data pre-processing, text processing, data mining techniques, text mining techniques, and advanced topics in both data and text mining. Each session will include a Python component, discussing the importance of Python and its libraries in handling various aspects of text and data mining. Students are not expected to know Python, rather they will be introduced to how Python can solve key issues so that they are aware of its capabilities. By the end of the course, participants will have a solid understanding of text and data mining concepts, be proficient in using Python for text and data mining tasks, and be able to apply these skills to real-world library applications and case studies.
